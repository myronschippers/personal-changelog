# Changelog for Personal Improvement

## Overview

This is a personal changelog of my updates. Not everything is code. This is meant to create visibility around the behaviors and habits for myself & those wanting to join in. Some of my goals for this challenge are listed below. Each changelog is meant to be a 30 day challenge to stretch personal goals.

> Note: this is meant to be a master log for several months
